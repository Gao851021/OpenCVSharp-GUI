# OpenCVSharp-GUI
An OpenCVSharp Visual Image Tool - OpenCVSharp-GUI

## Why?
Sometimes I just want to try some OpenCV image filters, but I just donÂ´t want to build a complete program to try it. This tool helped me a lot to see what each filter will do to any image.

## How to use it?
Just clone the repository and build it on Visual Studio 2013/2015. There is no messy dependencies or alien build configs.

## Your code sucks!
I know it! If you have any improvements please make a pull request and I will gladly accept it!

## I want to use your code!
Fell free! This program is covered by MIT License.
